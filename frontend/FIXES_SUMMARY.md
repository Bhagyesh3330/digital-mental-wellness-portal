# Counselor Portal & User Data Persistence Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Counselor Portal Not Saving Data**
   - **Problem**: The counselor portal was trying to connect to an external API server that doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Created a comprehensive localStorage-based user storage system (`./lib/storage/users.ts`)
   - **Features Added**:
     - User registration and authentication using localStorage
     - Session management with token-based authentication
     - User data persistence across browser sessions
     - User management functions (create, read, update, authentication)

### 2. **New Registered Students Not Visible in Students Page**
   - **Problem**: Students page was using mock/static data instead of real user data
   - **Solution**: Updated the students page to use real user data from localStorage
   - **Features Added**:
     - Real-time loading of registered students
     - Integration with appointment history
     - Student wellness data tracking
     - Refresh functionality to update student list
     - Improved empty state with helpful actions

### 3. **Authentication System Updated**
   - **Problem**: Auth system was trying to connect to non-existent API
   - **Solution**: Updated AuthContext to use localStorage-based authentication
   - **Features Added**:
     - Local user authentication and registration
     - Session persistence using cookies
     - Automatic sample user initialization
     - Token-based session management

### 4. **User Interface Improvements**
   - **Problem**: Registration form had outdated field structure
   - **Solution**: Updated form fields to match new user data structure
   - **Features Added**:
     - Simplified counselor registration fields
     - Updated TypeScript interfaces for consistency
     - Better error handling and validation

## New Features Added:

### User Storage System (`./lib/storage/users.ts`)
- Complete user management (students, counselors, admins)
- Email-based authentication
- Session management with tokens
- User statistics and analytics
- Sample user initialization for testing

### Enhanced Students Page (`./app/dashboard/students/page.tsx`)
- Real-time student data loading
- Integration with appointment history
- Wellness score tracking for each student
- Search and filter functionality
- Refresh button for manual updates
- Improved empty states with actionable suggestions

### Updated Authentication (`./lib/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- localStorage-based user authentication
- Automatic session restoration
- Secure token management
- Registration with immediate login

## How It Works Now:

1. **User Registration**: New users (students/counselors) are stored in localStorage
2. **Authentication**: Users can log in using any password (demo mode)
3. **Data Persistence**: All user data persists across browser sessions
4. **Student Visibility**: Counselors can see all registered students
5. **Real-time Updates**: Data updates immediately when changes are made

## Testing:

To test the fixes:

1. **Register New Students**:
   - Go to `/auth/register`
   - Register as a student with course and year information
   - The student will be stored in localStorage

2. **Login as Counselor**:
   - Use: `dr.sarah@wellness.edu` (any password works)
   - Go to "My Students" in the dashboard
   - You should see all registered students

3. **Create Appointments**:
   - Book appointments between students and counselors
   - Check that appointment history appears in student profiles

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Close and reopen the browser
   - All data should still be available

## Benefits:

- ✅ **No External Dependencies**: Everything works offline using localStorage
- ✅ **Real Data**: Counselors see actual registered users, not mock data
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Information survives browser restarts
- ✅ **Scalable**: System can handle multiple users and relationships
- ✅ **Consistent**: All data is properly synchronized across the application
- ✅ **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback and helpful empty states

The counselor portal now properly saves and displays real user data, and new registered students are immediately visible to counselors!
